# Landing pace project

This project resembles a webpage for a gymnastics company.

The site is divided into multiple sections to provide the most basic information a business owner should have on its company's page: a welcome section, price section and a contact section.

Each section has been created and stylized in order to provide information in a direct and simple manner, but at the same time maintain a smooth and chic appearance.

In this project, I placed a lot of emphasis on positioning with flexbox and styling with CSS and honing my html skills.
